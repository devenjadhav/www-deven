        greetings. i am a highschool senior from nashik, india. hackathons
        changed the trajectory of my life, and i am bringing them to 20,000
        students across the country by the end of 2024. i currently work as the
        head of events at <a href="https://codeday.org">[codeday]</a> and events
        and community manager at <a href=" ">[hack club]</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        apart from code, hackathons and coffee, i like playing the guitar,
        having deep conversations and ham radio (KQ4CHM). i am also learning to
        knit, and will hopefully have made a giant sweater soon. probably a pair
        of socks as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        my life revolves around a set of principles and beliefs that have come
        into existence over the last decade or so. all of those are documented
        in my <a href="/manifesto.html">[manifesto]</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        finally, if you're interested in organising hackathons or figuring out
        how to teach teens to code, please feel free to reach out to me via
        email. My email is my first name at this domain. (inspired by
        <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/">[patio11]</a>)
